# Daily-Work-Scheduler

## Description
This project is a daily work scheduler with the intention to help people organize their days. This scheduler will display the current day and color code the hour time slots with grey, red, and green. These colors represent the past, present, and future time slots respectively. Then, the user can input what they want to schedule and that input is saved to local storage. Finally, this input will persist in the respective time block.    

## Usage
* the user will input into any of the time blocks
* the user's input will be saved upon clicking the save button next to the time slot the user typed in

## Features
* time slots between 9AM and 5PM
* save button for each time
* color coded for past(grey), present(red), and future(green)
* text boxes for each time that will keep inputs after they are saved
